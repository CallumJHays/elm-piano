You can use it to create music aplications or\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nThe package itself does not handle any sound or other side effect, so the\r\ncomponent's only function is only to render an object that looks like a piano\r\nand select which key to appear to be pressed. Also it has an experimental,\r\nnot fully functional interactive mode so the keys the user clicks are markerd\r\nas pressed.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see examples of how to use it to generate sound you should \r\ncheck the example programs that use a MIDI.js port lo do it.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThe HTML and CSS of the piano is based on [michaelmp/js-piano][jspiano]\r\n\r\n[jspiano]: https://github.com/michaelmp/js-piano\r\n",
